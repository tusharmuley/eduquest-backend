PLEDGE

India is my country. All Indians
are my brothers and sisters.

I love my country, and I am proud
of its rich and varied heritage. I shall
always strive to be worthy of it.

I shall give my parents, teachers
and all elders respect, and treat
everyone with courtesy.

To my country and my people,

I pledge my devotion. In their
well-being and prosperity alone lies
my happiness.


The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 and National
Curriculum Framework 2005 are two of the most important events that have influenced
the field of primary education in the country, In the State of Maharashtra, too, primary
education curriculum was revised to reflect their guidelines and expectations. We are
happy to place this English Balbharati for Standard Five based on ‘Primary Education
Curriculum 2012? in your hands.

The RTE Actemphasizes all round development of the child, as also learning through
activities, discovery and exploration in a child-friendly and child-centred manner; making
the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety and helping the child to express views freely. We
have tried to design our textbooks so that these principles become a part of the teaching-
learning process.

Language plays a very important role at the primary level as other subjects, too, are
learnt through language. A child learns language from all sources - in school, at home and
from his/her environment, Teaching and learning of languages in school is designed to
provide a series of graded activities in a suitable environment with a view to developing
the child’s language skills and sensibilities to their full potential. The curriculum expects
a balanced development of all the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing

in the proper sequence. The emphasis in the initial years is on developing the child's
confidence and expression.

This textbook presents a number of activities in a particular sequence which will
allow the child to learn language actively and in an enjoyable manner. Some important
suggestions have been given for teachers and interested parents to help them motivate and
guide the children while learning English. Teachers should handle the various items given
in this book within the framework provided by the instructions.

The English Language Committee and the artist Reshma Barve have taken great
pains to prepare this textbook. It was reviewed by teachers and experts and their comments
and suggestions have helped us to give it a better shape. The Bureau is grateful to all of
them.

We hope that the textbook will receive a warm welcome from students, parents and
teachers.

This textbook will help the students to —

HR RR RHR SE

Enjoy reading stories and poems.

Take active interest in gathering information and presenting it in an attractive manner.
Learn to use a dictionary or other reference books.

Enjoy writing imaginatively simple short descriptions, stories and poems.

Write short reports, notes and essays.

Share interesting stories, information, puzzles, jokes, ete. with friends and others.
Learn to use polite language in speech and writing.

Learn to prepare and present short speeches with the help of teachers/parents.

The book contains stories, poems, informative passages, a play and a number of
activities. All these items are important. None of them should be ‘dropped’.

Taking into account the time available and the general ability of her students, the teacher
should employ different methods and techniques for dealing with different items.

Many of the exercises are open-ended. They do not have just one model answer.
They have been included to allow the children to think creatively in the context of
their experiences, feelings, ideas and world of imagination. The teacher should accept
and encourage a variety of imaginative answers in response to them, The personal
element in children’s responses should be valued.

Create an atmosphere that facilitates language learning —
Have faith in your students’ abilities to think and to use language.

Let the students speak and write a lot on their own.

DO NOT focus on grammatical rules and students’ errors when they are trying to
express themselves. You may feel that your students make too many mistakes. The best
solution to this is to show them how to correct their own work using dictionaries, and by
referring to similar constructions in the textbook. If necessary, have separate fortnightly
or monthly sessions on ‘How to correct your own work’, but don’t let grammar and
error correction get hold of all your teaching.

The classroom arrangement should be such that students can easily form pairs or
groups and you can easily move in the classroom to supervise their work.

Put up a board where students can display their work regularly.

Encourage students to circulate their writing in the classroom.

The atmosphere in the classroom should be friendly, inspiring confidence in EVERY
STUDENT. They should know that their teacher values their effort more than their
mistakes.

Multi-lingualism is @ strength, not a weakness. Encourage students to compare and
contrast English and other languages.

PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE READY-MADE OR ‘TEACHER-MADE*’ MODEL
ANSWERS. They harm more than they help.

reverenerenevenevanenns 1. What a Bird Thought - ---------- eee

1 lived first in a little house,
And lived there very well;

The world to me was small and round
And made of pale-blue shell.

I lived next in a little nest,
Nor needed any other;

I thought the world was made of straw,
And covered by my mother.

One day | fluttered from the nest,
To see what | could find.

I said, “The world is made of leaves;
I have been very blind.”

At last | flew beyond the tree,
And saw the sky so blue;

Now, how the world is really made
I cannot tell - can you?

1. Find and list the rhyming words from the poem.
2. Learn and recite the poem.

Once there lived a couple who
spent a lot of time in idle talk.

One day, the husband said, “I have
always wanted to keep cows. If, by
chance, | get some extra money from
somewhere, | am going to buy a few
cows.”

“But that means a lot of work.
You have to feed the cows, walk them,
bathe them, milk them — cows need a
lot of looking afler. One cow would be
enough. There’s no need to buy more
cows,” said the wife.

“But think of all the milk we'll
get if we buy more,” said the husband.
“That’s true.” The wife agreed.
“There will be so much milk that we
can even have plenty of dahi and butter
and ghee. Wouldn’t it be lovely ! How
lucky that I have all these earthen pots
kept aside. I'll use one of the pots for
milk, one for dahi, one for butter. The
ghee, I'll put in another jar. And I'll
use this remaining pot to send milk to
my sister.”

“Send milk to your sister! Who
said you could send milk to your
sister!”

“There will be plenty of milk,
if we have so many cows. Why
shouldn’t | send it to my sister?”

“Because we are going to sell it
in the market — that’s why. I will
decide what to do with all that milk.
And not a drop of it goes to your
sister, remember!”

“T'll sce how you can stop me
from sending a pot full of milk to
my dear sister. | do all the hard
work running after the cows so
naturally | will decide what happens
to the milk. Just try stopping me!”
the wife exclaimed.

Unit 1

“Is that so!” shouted the husband.
“Watch this, then!” He began to lift
and smash the earthen pots one by
one. His wife began to scream.

Gopal Bhand, who was passing
by, heard all the commotion and

rushed inside. When he heard what
had happened, he picked up a stout
stick that stood in a corner and began
to swish it through the air and pound
it on the floor. The husband and wife
were both astounded to see his antics.

“What are you doing?” they
enquired.

“Moye aside,” said Gopal Bhand.
“| have to drive away your greedy
cows. You have let them wander and
now they have ruined my ficld of
beans and cucumbers! Oh, my lovely
field of beans and cucumbers!”

“But you don’t have a field of
beans and cucumbers!” said the
husband. As soon as he said that,
Gopal Bhand stopped wielding the
stick and looked at him with raised
eyebrows. The husband and wife

It is important to be a ‘good
listener’ when you are learning a
language, or when you are dealing
with other people. Are you a ‘good
listener’? You can find it out with
the help of the following questions.

One. When you are listening to
someone, do you look at the personor
do you turn your head away or toy
with something else?

Good listeners look at the speaker.

Twe. Do you pay attention to
what the speaker is saying?

Good listeners pay close attention
to the speaker.

Three. Do you make any special
efforts to understand the speaker?

is saying. Then you can get your
doubts clarified by asking polite
questions,

Do not feel shy or afraid to ask
questions if you do not understand
what is being said. Put your
questions to the speaker politely.

a 5. The Twelve Months - esses

ONCE upon a time, in a faraway
country, there lived a mother who had
two daughters. One was her own child,
the other was her stepdaughter. She
was very fond of her own daughter, but
she hated her stepdaughter. The
only reason was that Marouckla, the
stepdaughter, was prettier than her own
daughter, Holena.

The gentle-hearted Marouckla did
not know how beautiful she was, and
so she could never make out why her
mother was always so cross with her.

Marouckla had to do all the
housework, tidying up the cottage,
cooking, washing, spinning, weaving
and sewing. She liked work and she did
it all without a word of complaint while
Holena spent the time adorning herself
and lazing about. Even then, Holena
and her mother scolded and rated and
abused Marouckla every day. They
envied her so much that one day, they
decided to throw her out in the freezing
cold to get rid of her.

“Go, Marouckla, and get me some
violets from the forest; | want to wear
them and to smell them,” said Holena,

“But, my dear sister, it is impossible
to find violets in the snow,” said poor
Marouckla.

“How dare you argue when | tell you
to do something? Off you go at once,
and if you don’t bring me violets from
the forest I'll kill you!” said Holena
threateningly.

The stepmother caught hold of
Marouckla, turned her out of the door,
and slammed it to after her.

Marouckla went into the forest
weeping bitterly. The snow lay deep,
and there wasn’t a human footprint to
be seen. Marouckla wandered about
for a long time, tortured by hunger and
trembling with cold.

At last, she saw a light in the
distance. She went towards the glow,
which came from the top of a mountain.
A big fire was burning there, and round
the fire were twelve stones with twelve
men sitting on them. Three of them had
snow-white beards, three were not so
old, and three were still younger. The
three youngest were the handsomest of
them all. They were not speaking, but
all sitting silent. These twelve men were
the twelve months. Great January sat
highest of all; his hair and beard were
as white as snow, and in his hand he
held a club.

Marouckla was frightened. She
stood still for a time in terror, but,
growing bolder, she went up to them and
said, “Please, kind sirs, let me warm my
hands at your fire.”

Great January nodded, and asked
her, “Why have you come here, my dear
little girl’? What are you looking for ?”

“Lam looking for violets,” answered
Marouckla.

“This is no time to be looking for
violets, for everything is covered with

- Unit t

snow,” answered Great January.

“Yes, | know; but my sister Holena
and my stepmother said that I must
bring them some violets from the forest.
If 1 don’t bring them, they'll kill me.
Tell me, fathers, please tell me where I
can find them.”

Great January stood up and went
to one of the younger months — it was
March — and, giving him the club, he
said, “Brother, take the high seat.”

Unit}

March took the high seat upon the
stone and waved the club over the fire.
The fire blazed up, the snow began to
melt, the trees began to bud, and the
ground was at once covered with grass.
It was springtime.

The violets began to bloom among
their little leaves, and before Marouckla
had time to think, so many of them had
sprung up that they looked like a blue
cloth spread out on the ground.

=_
a)

“Now, pick them
quickly, Marouckla!”
commanded March.

Marouckla picked them
joyfully till she had a big
bunch. Then she thanked the

months with all her heart and scampered
merrily home,

Holena and the — stepmother
wondered when they saw Marouckla
bringing the violets. They opened the
door to her, and the scent of violets
filled all the cottage.

“Where did you get them?” asked
Holena sulkily.

“They are growing under the bushes
in a forest on the high mountains.”

Holena snatched all the flowers
and did not give even a single one to
her sister.

The next day, she called to her sister
and said, “Go, Marouckla, and get me
some strawberries from the forest.”

“Alas! dear sister, where could
1 find any strawberries in this hard
winter ?” said Marouckla.

“How dare you argue! Go at once
and get me the strawberries, or I'll kill
you!”

The stepmother caught hold of
Marouckla and pushed her out of the
door and shut it after her.

Marouckla went to the forest
weeping bitterly. The snow was lying
deep, and there wasn’t a human

footprint to be seen anywhere. She
wandered about for a long time, tortured
by hunger and trembling with cold. At
last, she saw the light she had seen the
other day. Overjoyed, she went towards
it. She came to the great fire with the
twelve months sitting round it.

“Please, kind sirs, let me warm my
hands at the fire.”

Great January nodded, and asked
her, “Why have you come again, and
what are you looking for here?”

“1 am looking for strawberries. My
sister Holena and my stepmother bade
me bring some strawberries, and if |
don’t, they will kill me. Tell me, fathers,
tell me, please, where | can find them.”

Great January arose. He went over
to the month sitting opposite to him - it
was June - and handed the club to him,
saying, “Brother, take the high seat.”

June took the high seat upon the
stone and swung the club over the fire.
The fire shot up, and its heat melted
the snow in a moment. The ground was
all green, the trees were covered with
leaves, the birds began to sing, and the
forest was filled with all kinds of flowers.
It was summer. The ground under the
bushes was covered with white starlets,
the starry blossoms were turning into
strawberries every minute. They ripened
at once, and before Marouckla had time
to think, there were so many of them
that it looked as though a red carpet had
been spread on the ground.

“Pick them at once, Marouckla!”
commanded June.

- Unit t

Marouckla picked them joyfully till
she had filled her apron full, Then she
thanked the months with all her heart
and scampered merrily home.

Holena and the — stepmother
wondered when they saw Marouckla
bringing the strawberries. Her apron
was full of them.

“Where did you pick them?” asked
Holena sulkily.

“There are plenty of them growing
in the forest on the high mountains.”

Holena took all the strawberries,
and ate them all up with her mother,
They didn’t leave even a single one for
Marouckla.

On the third day, Holena ordered,
“Marouckla, go into the forest and get
me some red apples.”

The stepmother caught hold of
Marouckla and without giving her a
chance to speak, pushed her out of the
door and shut it after her,

Marouckla went to the forest again,
weeping bitterly. But she didn’t wander
about this time. She ran straight to the

top of the mountain where the big fire
was burning and the twelve months
were sitting round the fire.

“Please, kind sirs, help me.”

Great January nodded, and asked
her, “What are you looking for today ?”

“Lam looking for red apples. If
I don’t bring them, my sister and my
mother will kill me. Tell me, father, tell
me, please, where | could find them.”

Great January rose up. He went
over to one of the older months - it was
September. He handed the club to him
and said, “Brother, take the high seat.”

Month September took the high seat
upon the stone and swung the club over
the fire. The fire began to burn with
a red flame, the snow began to melt.
But there was a cold wind that sent the
faded leaves down to the ground. It
was autumn. Marouckla saw just one
apple-tree with red apples hanging high
among its branches.

“Shake the tree at once,
Marouckla!” commanded September.

Right gladly Marouckla shook the

tree, and first one apple fell down and
then another.

“Now, Marouckla, that’s enough.
Run home quickly!” shouted the
months.

Marouckla obeyed at once. She
picked up the apples, thanked the
months with all her heart, and ran
merrily home.

Holena and the — stepmother
wondered when they saw Marouckla
bringing the two apples.

“Where did you get them?” asked
Holena.

“| found them in the forest on the
high mountain.”

“And why didn’t you bring more?
Or did you eat them on the way
home ?” said Holena harshly.

“Alas! sister dear, | haven’t even
tasted them. [ shook the tree twice:
two apples fell down, and they wouldn't
let me shake the tree again. They
shouted to me to go straight home,”
protested Marouckla.

“May you be struck to death by
lightning!” said the wicked Holena
and began to eat the apple. It tasted
so delicious that she told her mother
she had never tasted anything so nice
in all her life. The stepmother liked
it too. When they had finished, they
wanted some more.

“Mother, give me my fur coat.
Let’s go to the forest ourselves and get
the apples. That ragged little wretch

would cat them all up again on her
way home. We'll find the place all
right, and Ill shake them all down,
however they shout at me.”

Her mother agreed readily. They
wrapped themselves in fur coats and
shawls and off they went to the forest.

The snow lay deep, and they
wandered about for a long time,
but at last they saw the top of the
mountain where the big fire was burning
and the twelve months were sitting.
They stepped up to the fire and
stretched out their hands to warm
them, without asking permission or
speaking one polite word.

“Why have you come here, and
what are you looking for?” asked
Great January crossly.

“Why do you want to know,
you old fool?” replied Holena angrily.
“It’s no business of yours,” said her
mother.

Great January frowned and
swung the club over his head. The
sky grew dark in a moment, the fire
burned low, the snow began to fall
thick and an icy wind began to blow
through the forest. Holena and her
mother couldn't see one step in front of
them.

They tried to find their way out but
the snow fell in huge masses, and soon,
they were lost in it.

At home, Marouckla waited and
waited and yet Holena and her mother
did not come back. When she went

Saturday, 15 August 1936. It was
the day of the Hockey finals during the
Olympic events held in Berlin, Germany.
Germany had defeated several teams to
enter the finals against the Indian team.
They were the hosts of the Olympics,
and they were sure of their victory.
Perhaps that was the reason why their
ruler Hitler had himself come to watch
the match.

All the day before, it had rained
heavily. The entire field had become
water-logged. But 15" August being the
last day of the Games, it was not possible
to postpone the match any further. The
Indian team was a little under pressure
as they had lost to Germany in the
practice match and they were not very
comfortable with the wet ground.

About forty thousand people had
gathered in the hockey stadium to cheer

Germany against India. The Maharaja
of Baroda State, the Prince of Bhopal
and a few other Indians had also come
to support the Indian Team.

The match started exactly at 11 am.
The German team had adopted a novel
strategy of using the Indian technique of
short distance passes against the Indian
team itself. They had resorted to a very
aggressive play. The Indian team was
offering an equally strong resistance.
No team could make a goal during the
first half hour. During the 32nd minute,
Roop Singh scored the first goal, hitting
the ball towards the goalpost from a
difficult angle.

In the second half of the match, the
Indian team found a firm footing. The
entire team played as one and made
three more goals against Germany.
Two of them were made by the Captain
of the Indian team, Dhyan Chand.
However, the German players were also
trying their level best to win. They, too,
succeeded in making one goal.

Now, only a few last minutes were
left. Dhyan Chand had resolved to win

Unit 1

the match at any cost without allowing
Germany to make any more goals. His
spiked shoes were making it difficult
for him to run fast on the wet ground.
He removed the shoes and the socks
and began to run barefoot. Using his
amazing skill of dribbling and his near-
magical game, he began to send one pass
after another to the players in the *D’,
that is. in the defenders’ or opponents*
area from where they could make
goals. They, too, did not let the passes
go waste. The Indian team scored three
more goals. Dhyan Chand could have
easily made the goals himself from his
own position, but he never played a
selfish game. Skilfully, he took the ball
away from the German defenders and
made it possible for the players in the D
to score goals.

The German strategy had proved
fruitless. A defeat stared them in the
face. Some of the frustrated German
players then resorted to a rough game.
The German goalkeeper pounced on
Dhyan Chand and hurt him. But Dhyan
Chand was a true soldier, After a little
first-aid, he immediately returned to the
field and held the spectators spellbound
with his game. At last, he scored the last
goal of the match just as the game drew
to a close. The Indian team had won
third time in a row. It was a hat-trick.
Indians were the third time winners of
the Olympic gold medal.

Although Hitler left the stadium
before the match was over, he was
impressed by Dhyan Chand’s game.
It is said that the German dictator had
offered Dhyan Chand a higher salary

Unit!

and rank in the German army, if he
agreed to play on behalf of Germany,
but Dhyan Chand turned down the
offer. After the celebrated victory in
the Olympics, Hitler awarded a special
gold medal to Dhyan Chand.

You may be aware that hockey is
our national sport. Major Dhyan
Chand’s birthday, August 29 is
celebrated as National Sports Day in
India. The famous national stadium
in Delhi is named after the great hero
‘Dhyan Chand’. Who knows, perhaps
one of you may carry the legacy of
Dhyan Chand further and win great
glory for our country.

Sanjay Dudhane, Sports Writer.

* You need not mention the names of
your friends in your presentation.
You should only give a summary of
what you observe in the responses
given by many people.

Your presentation should clearly
show what many or most people
enjoy, appreciate, fear, ete; what
only some of them mention, and
what only one or two mention.

If necessary, you may point out
what is not mentioned by any of
the people. For example, you may
say, ‘It appears that nobody is
afraid of examinations, as no one

they fear!”

You should also mention what
you found most interesting in
the responses, at the end of your
presentation.

You must take care to see that you
do not hurt anyone’s feelings when
you get the sheets filled or when
you make your presentation.

9. The Triantiwontigongolope - ------------------++--

There’s a very funny insect that you do not often spy,

And it isn’t quite a spider, and it isn’t quite a fly;

It is something like a beetle, and a little like a bee,

But nothing like a woolly grub that climbs upon a tree.

Its name is quite a hard one, but you'll learn it soon, | hope.

So try:

‘Tri-

Tri-antinventi-

Triantiwontigongolope.

It lives on weeds and wattle-gum, and has a funny face;
Its appetite is hearty, and its manners a disgrace.

When first you come upon it, it will give you quite a scare,
But when you look for it again, you find it isn’t there.

And unless you call it softly it will stay away and mope.

So try:
Tri-

‘Tri-anti-vonti-
Triantiwontigongolope.

It trembles if you tickle it or read upon its toes;
It is not an early riser, but it has a snubbish nose.
If you sneer at it, or scold it, it will scuttle off in shame,
But it purrs and purrs quite proudly if you call it by its name,
And offer it some sandwiches of sealing-wax and soap.
So try:
Tri-

‘Tri-aptizwonti-

Triantiwontigongolope.

Y

But of course you haven't seen it; and I truthfully confess

That I haven’t seen it either, and | don’t know its address.

For there isn’t such an insect, though there really might have been

If the trees and grass were purple, and the sky was bottle green.

It’s just a little joke of mine, which you'll forgive, | hope.

1. Read the poem aloud using proper intonation.

2. Note that we say ‘its appetite’, ‘its manners’ and not ‘it's appetite’ or ‘it’s manners’.
[I's] means ‘It is* and [its] means ‘belonging to it’.

3. Activities

(1) Is the insect described in the poem a real insect ? Think about an imaginary creature.
Describe it in your own words. You may draw its picture and label it.

You may have read many stories
about three brothers. Usually, two of
them — the elder ones are strong, clever
but unkind. They laugh at the youngest
one because he is too simple and soft-
hearted.

Our story also has three brothers
who lived in a small town but they were
all three of them honest, kind and hard-
working. The elder one ran a shop, the
middle one was a priest and the youngest
one had just finished his education, He
had started taking up odd jobs to earn
some money and to learn a trade. All
three of them were fond of their mother.
She had worked hard to bring up the
three of them after the sudden death of
their father.

One day, their father’s friend visited
the mother. He said, “Sister, you know
that I have a very prosperous business.

But now | am getting old, and my only
daughter is of a marriageable age. | am
looking for a son-in-law who would be
a good husband to my daughter and
who would also handle my business
well. | like all your sons. If you permit,

Pll marry my daughter to one of them
but before that I have a plan.”

He discussed the plan with her and
she agreed quite readily.

The next day, the friend went to
each of the three brothers one by one.
He gave them each a sack of rice and
said, “My dear boy, | am going away
for a few months for some necessary
work. Please look after this sack of rice
till | came back.”

The friend went away. Many
months passed but he did not return.
It was nearly a year before he came
back. He visited the eldest brother first.
The eldest brother welcomed him and
gave him a small purse full of money.
“Uncle, you had left a sack of rice with
me. After a few months, | was worried
that it may get spoilt. Therefore | sold
the rice to my customers. Here’s the
money I got. Please accept it.”

“Thank you, my boy, you are such
an honest person !”


Then the friend went to see the
middle brother, who was a priest. The
priest greeted him with joy and affection.
He said, “Uncle, remember you had left
a sack of rice with me, an year ago ? |
had kept it for many months, but then
1 was worried that it may get spoilt. |
distributed the rice among the poor in
your name. They all blessed you for
satisfying their hunger. However, | did
that without your permission and | am
willing to pay you back for the rice.”

“No, my boy, you acted wisely and
kindly. The blessings that | got from the
poor people are enough for me. Please
don’t even think about the money any

”

When the friend went to visit the
youngest son, he, too, welcomed him
with love and respect. But he said that

he had a confession to make. “The sack
of rice was lying with me for a long
time. But then I had an idea. | often

a seeepenenncnnessersernene 13. The Adventures of Gullliver . .:::.....:::::-..-

Gulliver's Travels is an interesting book written by a well-known English writer,
Jonathan Swift, in which he desevibes the voyages ef Gulliver to various lands
like Lilliput and Brabdingnag. Though the character of Gulliver and these strange-
sounding lands are imaginary, Gulliver's experiences and adventures are written so
well that they seem real and true to life,

Gulliver, the stery tells us, worked as a surgeon on ships. As such, he made
several voyages. In May 1699, he sailed on the ship ‘The Antelope’. On the return
journey, in November, a violent storm sank his ship and Gulliver swam to save his
life, Late in the evening, he found himself marooned on a strange land, Weak and

exhausted, he slept for about nine hours, It was daylight when he awoke.
Let us read what happened next in his own words.

Gulliver Meets the Lilliputians

‘I tried to get up from the ground,
but | could not move! 1 was lying on my
back. Then | found that my arms and
feet were held down to the ground with
strings. My hair, which was long, was
held down in the same way. Thousands
of strings had been passed across my
body, so that I could not move any part
of me, but could only lie there on my
back looking up at the sky.

Ina little time, | felt something alive
moving on my foot. Then it came over

my bedy and up to my face. Turning my
eyes down as much as | could, | saw a
man. He was not half a foot high. By his
dress, he seemed to be a soldier. Then
there came forty more, following the
first.

1 was so much surprised that I
gave a great cry. Then they all ran
back in great fear; and (as | was
told later) some of them were hurt
in jumping down from my side on
to the ground.”


Gulliver Attempts to Pull Free

“After pulling very hard [ got one
arm up from the ground. | also raised my
head; this gave me great pain for many
of the hairs were pulled out. 1 put out my
hand to catch some of the little men; but
they ran away before | could close my
hand on them. Then | heard a noise, and
felt a pricking in my hand like that of a
thousand needles. | found that they were
shooting arrows at me. | was afraid for
my eyes, | put my hand over my face.
Afier this, | thought that the wisest thing

to do was to lie quiet till night. I thought
that then, my hand being free, | could
quickly set free the rest of my body.

Soon a platform was raised and
an important-looking man gave a long
speech. From his gestures, | guessed
that he was trying to tell me that
they would not harm me, if | did as
they told. I too, replied with gestures
that | would remain quiet. I also told
them that | was hungry.”

ee

Gulliver Eats a Giant Meal

“At once, a hundred men climbed
up on to my body and marched up to
my mouth, carrying food. The bread
was as small as bullets. So I ate two
or three loaves at a time and cries of
surprise rose from the Lilliputians that
1 should eat so quickly and so much.
The Lilliputians were no longer afraid
of me. They danced upon my body and
ran to and fro. | could have caught at
least forty of them with my hands and
thrown them down. But I remembered

my promise to remain quiet. Indeed,
I was surprised at their bravery for I
must have seemed the greatest giant in
the world.

Later, | was taken to the city where
the king lived. A great cart was made by
joining many carts. Nine hundred men
worked for three hours to put me on to
the cart which was drawn by fifteen
hundred of the king’s finest horses. The
city was just half a mile away but the
journey took almost a full day.”

Unit 2

Gulliver’s New Home

‘The king came out to mect me; he
came near and looked at me, but it was
not thought safe for him to climb up on
me.

At the place where the cart stopped
there was an old church. It was the
largest building in the whole country.
For certain reasons, it had not been used
as a church for many years. It had now
been made ready for me to use as my
house. The great door on the north was
four feet high and two feet wide. So, |

could go into it by going down on my
hand. One of my feet was set in a great
ring on the end of many strong strings
so that I could not get away, but could
only walk some distance outside my
door. The country outside looked like a
garden.

After some days, the king and his
people were convinced that I would
not harm them. So, after | agreed to
keep certain ‘orders’ of the king, | was
allowed to move around.’

ee

Gulliver Visits the City and the Queen

‘As soon as | was set free | asked
if 1 might see the city. The king was
pleased to let me do this. Orders were
given to all the people to remain in their
houses. | then stepped over the wall.
and went very carefully, along the two
largest streets. All the windows were
full of faces looking out at me, and
large numbers of people were standing

on the tops of the houses. The king’s
house was just at the place where two
great streets met. There was a beautiful
garden on all sides of it. Lying down in
the garden I put my eye to the windows.
The rooms inside were very beautiful.
In one room, | saw the queen and some
of the young princes. They were greatly
pleased by my visit.”

Mrs Joshi : | know! I'm going to
send for the Mayor at once. He

broken objects around.

Hawker No one is safe. Let's
request the Mayor to come and
see for himself.

Mr Desai : Vil fetch him. (vit)

(Enters again with the Mayor and his
retinue.)

Mayor (Annoyed) Unbelievable!
Shocking! How do you expect
people to walk through all this
rubbish? Why don’t you all
dispose of the garbage properly?

Mrs Patel : But we do, Mr Mayor.
We give our garbage to the
garbage collector.

Mrs Joshi : Yes, we don’t litter our
streets like this.

Mr Desai : Or we take it to the
dumping ground near the river-

side - away from here. The
rains then wash it away.

Mrs Patel : Or the winds blow it

away.

Mayor : Then how did it come back
into the town overnight?

Who is responsible for this mess?

Animals : We are responsible!

We have brought in all the litter.

We have spread the garbage all
over the town.
Deer : Yes! We confess we did so.
Mayor : What? You! How dare you?

Mrs Joshi : What right do you have
to spoil our town and make it
unsafe to move around?

Bear : (comes forward) We have
only brought back to you what
belongs to you. Tell me, what
right do you have to dump all
this in the forests? The forest is
our dwelling place.

Birds : Our trees are dying and
vanishing because of you. Where
can we roost or build nests?

Squirrel : And where can we live?

Rabbit You are worried about
Madhu being injured because of
sharp broken glass - Don’t our
young ones get injured too?

Deer : Yes! And we have no doctor
to dress their wounds. Our young
ones simply die.

Madhu/ Nidhi Oh,
shocking! Terrible!

no! How

Tortoise : All the fish in the rivers
and lakes die because of the
waste dumped in water. How we
suffer because of the chemicals
and poisons!

Bear : And so many animals who
drink the polluted water fall ill
and die.

Dr Sawant : Yes. It is unfortunately
true.

Peacock : So we called a meeting
and decided to return all your
dangerous stuff back to you. We
don’t need it.

Bear : Anyway, we were not as
cruel as you are! We have only
returned the garbage. We have
not poured chemicals and poisons
onto your settlements,

Mayor : | see. You animals and birds
do have a point. You are right.

Mr Desai: You have opened our
eyes. We should not dump rubbish
in the forests or rivers or lakes.

Mrs Patel : But where can we dispose
of it?

Mayor : If you all agree to sort out
the litter, | will arrange for it
to be collected separately. Then,
some of it can go for processing
and some, for recycling.

Mrs Joshi : Good idea! Let's do just
that.

Mayor : Let us save our mother
earth from further harm. (Jo
the animals) Thank you, dear
animals for teaching us a lesson
so effectively. We assure you,
we will not pollute or spoil your
homes. | shall even warn those
who go there for picnics.

Some animals Thank = you,
Mr Mayor! Thank you. (They
return.)

Mayor : Self-help is the best help.

Let’s clear this up. (All including
the Mayor start picking up the
litter.)

In our garden we have made
Such a pretty little pool,

Lined with pebbles neatly laid,
Filled with water clean and cool.

When the sun shines warm and high
Robins cluster round its brink,
Never one comes flying by

But will flutter down to drink,

Then they splash and splash and splash,
Spattering little showers bright

All around, till off they flash

Singing sweetly their delight.

Most of the parents like to fulfil the
wishes of their children. They feel sorry
when they cannot indulge their kids
or when they have to scold them. And
when even a scolding has no effect,
the parents become very very unhappy.
Such was the case with Anshuman and
his parents,

Anshuman’s parents had noticed
that he was developing some bad habits.
Naturally, they began to warn him time
and again, but all in vain. Anshuman
just wouldn't listen. He refused to
believe that he was letting those bad
habits get a hold over him, Gentle
words, strict warnings, a scolding now
and then — his parents tried everything
short of beating him up. And that they
would never do. However unhappy they
themselves were, they wanted to be
loving and gentle as they tried to correct
their son’s ways.

Soon, an opportunity presented
itself. Anshuman had gone to stay on
his grandfather’s farm with his parents.
Early one morning, his father took him

for a walk around the farm. He was
describing the specialities of various
plants and vines and bushes and trees
to Anshuman. Suddenly, he stopped
and pointed at a small seedling growing
near a plant.

“Anshuman, that’s a weed, Can you
pull it out?”

Anshuman had no difficulty in
pulling all of the small seedling out.
“Good!” said his father and they
continued with their walk. After a
while, they came upon the same weed
but there, it had grown slightly bigger.
Anshuman’s father told him to pull out
this plant, too. He told him to uproot
the weed carefully, making sure that no
trace of the root was left in the soil.

“Otherwise the weed can grow
again,” he warned.

Anshuman uprooted the plant
carefully, twisting it and pulling it hard
so that the whole of it came out.

Then his father drew his attention
to the same weed growing at some


distance. There, it had grown into a big
plant with tiny flowers and dark fruit.

“That could be quite dangerous. We
mustn't leave it growing there. Take it
out,” said Anshuman’s father.

Anshuman held the plant in his
hands and gave it a tug. The weed
didn*t move at all. He pulled harder and
harder but to no avail.

“I can’t get this out!” exclaimed
Anshuman, “It has gone too deep into
the soil.”

So then his father brought some
implements, they dug around the weed
and with great effort, pulled it out.

When they were returning home
after the hard work, Anshuman’s father
mentioned, “Habits are like weeds. The

longer you allow them to grow, the
harder it is to uproot them. It is wise to
get rid of them when it is easy to do so.”

Anshuman realized the truth in his
father’s words. Throughout his life, he
never forgot that carly morning walk on
the farm with his father.

2. Add proper prefixes like up- , un-, dis- , in- to the following to form opposites.

exepasaauerpemerseneevens 21. The Journey to the Great Oz - oveseeaececerensenanaee

The Wizard of Oz is a well-known fantasy of children’s literature. It tells the story
of Dearothy who is whisked with her dog Toto, by the cyclone to the wenderful land of
Oz, There she meets the Tin Woodman who needs a heart, the Scarecrow who needs
brains and the cowardly lion who needs bravery. They all want to see the Wizard of
Oz, the only person who can help them, Here's an account of a part of their journey
fo the Emerald City of Oz where the Wizard lives, Read the Wizard of Oz te find out

what happens next

The Wizard of Oz was written by Lyman Frank Baum (1856-1919), He has written
many other books about Oz. This classic novel was also made into a mavie.

This was to be an eventful day for
the travellers. They had hardly been
walking an hour when they saw before
them a great ditch that crossed the road
and divided the forest as far as they
could see on either side. It was a very
wide ditch, and when they crept up to
the edge and looked into it they could
see it was also very deep, and there were
many big, jagged rocks at the bottom.
The sides were so steep that none of them
could climb down, and for a moment it
seemed that their journey must end.

“What shall we do?” asked Dorothy
despairingly.
“I haven't the faintest idea,” said

the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook
his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.

But the Scarecrow said, “We cannot
fly, that is certain. Neither can we climb
down into this great ditch. Therefore, if
we cannot jump over it, we must stop
where we are.”

“| think I could jump over it,” said
the Cowardly Lion, after measuring the
distance carefully in his mind.

“Then we are all right,” answered
the Scarecrow, “for you can carry us all
over on your back, one at a time.”

“Well, I'll try it,” said the Lion,
“Who will go first?”

4+.— Unit 3

“I will,” declared the Scarecrow,
“for, if you found that you could not
jump over the gulf, Dorothy would
be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly
dented on the rocks below. But if | am
on your back it will not matter so much,
for the fall would not hurt me at all.”

“Tam terribly afraid of falling,
myself,” said the Cowardly Lion, “but
1 suppose there is nothing to do but try
it. So get on my back and we will make
the attempt.”

The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion’s
back, and the big beast walked to the
edge of the gulf and crouched down.

“Why don’t you run and jump?”
asked the Scarecrow.

“Because that isn’t the way we
Lions do these things,” he replied. Then
giving @ great spring, he shot through
the air and landed safely on the other
side. They were all greatly pleased to
see how casily he did it, and after the
Scarecrow had got down from his back
the Lion sprang across the ditch again.

Dorothy thought she would go next;
so she took Toto in her arms and climbed
on the Lion’s back, holding tightly to his
mane with one hand. The next moment
it seemed as if she were flying through

Unit 3

the air; and then, before she had time to
think about it, she was safe on the other
side. The Lion went back a third time
and got the Tin Woodman, and then
they all sat down for a few moments to
give the beast a chance to rest, for his
great leaps had made his breath short,
and he panted like a big dog that has
been running too long.

They found the forest very thick on
this side, and it looked dark and gloomy.
After the Lion had rested they started
along the road of yellow brick, silently
wondering, cach in his own mind, if
ever they would come to the end of the
woods and reach the bright sunshine
again. To add to their discomfort, they
soon heard strange noises in the depths
of the forest, and the Lion whispered
to them that it was in this part of the
country that the Kalidahs lived.

“What are the Kalidahs?” asked
the girl.

“They are monstrous beasts with
bodies like bears and heads like tigers,”
replied the Lion, “and with claws so
long and sharp that they could tear me
in two as easily as | could kill Toto. I’m
terribly afraid of the Kalidahs.”


“I'm not surprised that you are,”
returned Dorothy. “They must be
dreadful beasts.”

The Lion was about to reply
when suddenly they came to another
gulf across the road. But this one was
so broad and deep that the Lion knew
at once he could not leap across it.

So they sat down to consider
what they should do, and after serious
thought the Scarecrow said:

“Here is a great tree, standing
close to the ditch. Ifthe Tin Woodman
can chop it down, so that it will fall
to the other side, we can walk across
it easily.”

“That is a first-rate idea,” said —

the Lion. “One would almost suspect
you had brains in your head, instead
of straw.”

The Woodman set to work at
once, and so sharp was his axe that
the tree was soon chopped nearly

through. Then the Lion put his strong
front legs against the tree and pushed
with all his might, and slowly the big
tree tipped and fell with a crash across
the ditch, with its top branches on the
other side.

They had just started to cross this
queer bridge when a sharp growl made
them all look up, and to their horror
they saw running toward them two great
beasts with bodies like bears and heads
like tigers.

“They are the Kalidahs!” said the
Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.

“Quick!” cried the Scarecrow. “Let
us cross over.”

So Dorothy went first, holding Toto
in her arms, the Tin Woodman followed,
and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion,
although he was certainly afraid, turned
to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave
so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothy
screamed and the Scarecrow fell over
backward, while even the fierce beasts
stopped short and looked at him in
surprise,

But, seeing they were bigger than |
the Lion, and remembering that there
were two of them and only one of him,
the Kalidahs again rushed forward,
and the Lion crossed over the tree and
turned to see what they would do next.
Without stopping an instant the fierce

, beasts also began to cross the tree. And

the Lion said to Dorothy:

“We are lost, for they will surely |
tear us to pieces with their sharp claws.
\But stand close behind me, and I will

ewe Alnnit 3

fight them as long as | am alive.”

“Wait a minute!” called the
Scarecrow. He had been thinking what
was best to be done, and now he asked
the Woodman to chop away the end
of the tree that rested on their side of
the ditch. The Tin Woodman began to
use his axe at once, and, just as the two
Kalidahs were nearly across, the tree
fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying
the ugly, snarling brutes with it, and
both were dashed to pieces on the sharp
rocks at the bottom.

“Well,” said the Cowardly Lion,
drawing a long breath of relief, “I see
we are going to live a little while longer,
and | am glad of it, for it must be a very
uncomfortable thing not to be alive.
Those creatures frightened me so badly
that my heart is beating yet.”

“Ah,” said the Tin Woodman sadly,
“I wish | had a heart to beat.”

This adventure made the travellers
more anxious than ever to get out of
the forest, and they walked so fast that
Dorothy became tired, and had to ride
on the Lion’s back. To their great joy
the trees became thinner the farther
they advanced, and in the afternoon
they suddenly came upon a broad river,
flowing swiftly just before them. On the
other side of the water they could see the
road of yellow brick running through a
beautiful country, with green meadows
dotted with bright flowers and all the
road bordered with trees hanging full
of delicious fruits. They were greatly
pleased to see this delightful country
before them.

George’s Secret Key to the Universe

George’s Dad is an ardent environmentalist. In fact,
both his parents are convinced that modern inventions
of science and technology have caused a lot of damage
on the earth. They are committed to the cause of saving
the planet. They use a bicycle instead of a car. There is a
ban on TV and computers in their house. They don’t buy
things like bread and biscuits. They cat only vegetarian
and home cooked food. They even use candles to light
the house to avoid using electricity. Poor George has
to suffer a lot of jeering and ridicule from his friends
because of all this.

Actually, George doesn’t think that either the T
or the computer is a bad thing. He has tried to tell his
parents that it’s possible to save the carth using the
computers and the internet. But no! In their house,
there can’t be ANY discussion on that issue. George
always likes to know ‘why’. But who is to answer his
questions ? His parents think that he is still too young to
understand global issues.

One day, however, George unexpectedly acquires a
new friend and next door neighbour — Annie. Annie’s
father Eric is a brilliant scientist and ever willing to
answer all of George’s questions. Eric has built a super
super intelligent computer named Cosmos. Cosmos has
incredible powers. It can literally open windows on the
universe and take you to any planet, star, comet and
even to a black hole! And of course Cosmos can also
bring you back from there. However, Cosmos depends
entirely on the information that is fed into it by people


like Eric who do the research and
thinking that can make Cosmos work.

Science can be used for a good
cause and a group of good scientists like
Eric have vowed to use it for people’s
welfare. Unfortunately, there is one
odd angry scientist who wants to use
science for his own selfish motives. He
is planning to steal Cosmos and all of
Eric’s research so that he can establish
his own rule on another planet. It
so happens that only George can do
something to overcome the wicked
plans of the nasty scientist. If you want
to know what adventures he undertakes
and what strategies he has to use to stop
the power hungry scientist, you have to
read the novel, “George’s Secret Key to
the Universe’.

The author of this wonderful
adventure is Lucy Hawking. The story
of the novel is imaginary but it also
includes plenty of charts, photographs,
boxes that give you hard facts about
our solar system, galaxies, space and
the whole universe. This information

has been presented in a very simple,
easy to understand manner by none
other than Stephen Hawking, who is
said to be one of the greatest scientists
of our times. His achievements are all
the more astounding as he is a victim of
many physical ailments. He has to use
a wheelchair to move about and uses a
computerised voice system in order to
‘speak’. The story of Stephen Hawking’s
triumph over his physical disabilities is
itself an inspiring adventure.

The book includes very attractive
and expressive sketches drawn by Garry
Parsons.

It is true that the excessive use of
science and technology can give rise
to certain problems, But turning away
from technology is not the solution.
That is why the Hawkings have given
an important message in this book
~ More research, more studies and a
commitment to use them not for selfish
gains but for the welfare of the entire
living world!

What a farmer needs most for his
fields is a good source of water. Kasim
had his eye on a well that was just
outside the boundary of his field. But
Ahmad, the man who owned the well,
was acrafly old man. He wouldn’t allow
anyone to draw water from his well. He
told Kasim, “Why do you come to me
again and again to beg for access to
my well ? | feel sorry to turn down your
request every time. | have a suggestion
for you. Collect some money and buy
the whole well from me.”

Kasim thought over the suggestion
and liked it. He knew Ahmad would
ask for a lot of money but he saw in his
mind’s eye, channels of water running
from the well through his field and
made a decision. He took all his savings
to Ahmad and bought the well.

The next day, he went to the well
happily and dug out a channel. But
when he began to draw water, there was

a surprise in store for him. Suddenly
Ahmad came forward and announced,
“What are you doing, Kasim? How dare
you touch the water in my presence?”

“What do you mean - haven't you
sold this well to me?”

“Ah, I sold the well all right, but
not the water in the well. The water

still belongs to me. You can’t use it. If
you needed the water along with the
well, you should have said so. | have
a suggestion for you. Pay for the water
separately and use it. You can buy fresh
water every day. | don’t mind!”

Kasim was shocked to hear
Ahmad’s argument. It was so unfair,
so unjust ! He rushed to the Qazi and
told him the whole story. The Qazi was
a wise man. He told Kasim to bring
Ahmad to his court so that he could hear
both sides of the case.

Ahmad was summoned to the court.
The Qazi heard his argument patiently.

“Hmm, | see that you are right. What
you have sold is the weil, the water is all
yours. Isn’t that so?”

Kasim’s heart sank, when he heard
the Qazi’s words. Ahmad in his heart
of hearts was overjoyed. He had never
thought the Qazi would side with him.

1. Find a word that has a similar meaning.
* unfair

* sorry * whole * happily

2. Answer the following questions.

“My Lord, | am so grateful you
understand the fine points of this case.
The water does indeed belong to me.”

“In that case, Ahmad, why are you
keeping it in Kasim’s well? You have
no right to keep your belongings in
his property, You must remove them
immediately. Or else, you can pay a
daily rent to Kasim. Then he will allow
you to use his well.”

Ahmad was so confused that he did
not know what to say. All the people
present in the court began to laugh.

But Kasim was a generous man. He
never troubled Ahmad for the ‘rent’ that
was due from him.

nae 27. The Legend of Marathon

The ‘marathon’ is a sporting event. It is a running race of about 42 kilometres.
The word ‘marathon’ also means ‘a task or event that lasts a long time and requires

a lot of effort and patience’.

The first marathon race was organized at the time of the first Olympic Games
which were held in Greece. The marathon was started in the memory of a legendary
Greek hero, Pheidippides, who had carried an important message from the battle
of Marathon to Athens. Given below is the story of his famous run from Marathon
to Athens. We do not know whether the story is historically accurate, but it has

inspired many generations of sportsmen.

About two thousand and five
hundred years ago, Persia was a mighty
kingdom. Their large army had landed
in the bay near the town of Marathon.
Their target was Athens, a city state
in Greece. Athens had a small army
compared to the Persian one. But the
Athenian soldiers were very brave.
They had faced the Persians before,
but they needed help from other Greek
kingdoms now. They decided to send a
special messenger to the neighbouring
kingdom of Sparta. His name was
Pheidippides.

Pheidippides was a young man who
served as a ‘day-long runner’, He ran
to Sparta like the wind. He covered the
distance of nearly a hundred kilometres

in a day. But alas! The people of Sparta
were busy with some ceremonies.
They did not want to join the battle
immediately. Pheidippides took this
message back to Athens with a heavy
heart, but on light feet. Again, he ran a
hundred kilometres within a day.

When the Generals of Athens heard
the cold Spartan response, they did not
lose heart. They were ready to fight
on their own. The Persian army was
watching Athens like a cat watches a
mouschole. So, they decided to launch
a surprise attack on the Persians. The
Athenian Generals sent their flanks
round the Persian forces like speeding
arrows and began to draw them in.
The Persians were not ready for battle.


Even so, they were skilled archers.

They showered arrows on the soldiers
of Athens. But the arrows simply fell off
their helmets and strong armours. Also,
the Athenians knew their seashore well.
The Persians were new to the terrain,
Many of them were killed. Many more
were injured, Some of them were lost in
the marshy areas. The brave Athenians
drove back every single remaining
Persian soldier back to their ships
anchored in the bay. The battle was
over within a few hours.

The battle was over but the Persians
did not accept defeat. They saw that the
entire army of Athens had rushed to the
seashore, leaving the city of Athens far
behind. Only the aged people, women
and children were left in the city. The
Persians now devised a new plan. The
sea-route to the city of Athens was much
shorter than the land route. The Persians
decided to take the sea-route and pounce
upon Athens from the seaside. The

(66)

Athenian army would take very long to
travel back to Athens on foot, with their
heavy armour and weapons. Seeing the
Persians, the defenceless people in the
city of Athens would think that Athens
had lost the battle. Then it would be easy
for the Persians to take over the city.

The Athenian Generals too, were
good strategists. When they saw the
Persian fleet leave in a hurry, they
understood the Persian plan. They
resolved to go back to Athens as fast
as possible to defend it. But, it was
very necessary to let the people of
Athens know that they had won, Then
they would not open the city gates to
the Persians. They would wait for the
victorious Athenian army to return. The
city would be safe. Who would take this
message to them? The message must be
delivered before the Persians reached
there. Who would travel faster than the
Persian ships and that too, on a longer
route? Who else but Pheidippides !

Pheidippides had already completed
a run of more than two hundred
kilometres just the day before. But he
was a brave young man. He would do
anything for his State. Also, this time he
was to carry a happy message.

It was not easy for Pheidippides to
reach Athens sooner than the Persians
did. That is why, this time, he left the
usual safe route and chose another one
that passed through cliffs and mountains
but was much shorter.

Pheidippides scaled the first steep
cliff and picked up speed. He had to
run more than forty kilometres. It was
very hot. He began to perspire. There
were some shady olive trees on one side
of the road. But Pheidippides couldn't
wait, couldn’t rest. He just ran on and
on. His heart began to beat faster, he
became weak with hunger and thirst,
but he didn’t stop.

At last, Pheidippides came within
sight of the city-gates of Athens! He

was successful in his mission. He had
reached before the Persians.

The people of Athens threw open
the gates to Pheidippides.

“What happened, Pheidippides? Do
you bring good news or......?”

“Yes ! Yes ! Joy to you ! We won !
We won !” As soon as Pheidippides had
delivered this message, he collapsed —
never to rise again. He had laid down
his life in the service of Athens.

The story of Pheidippides has
inspired the people of Greece for
many centuries. His historic run from
Marathon to Athens became a legend.

When the Olympic Games were
started in Greece, this legendary event
was commemorated in it in the form
of the sporting event, the marathon.
Today, marathons are arranged in many
countries. When you see one, or when
you are old cnough to take part in one,
remember the first marathon runner.

We all need money to buy things
and to pay people who work for us.

But what is ‘money’?

Who invented ‘money’?

Today, we see money in the
form of coins and notes.

These are the coins and notes we use in India.
But different countries use different coins and notes.
Their money is known by different names.


In the United States, they use ($) dollars,
In England, they use (£) pounds.

But long. long ago, people did not use coins and notes.
They exchanged one thing for another.
This was known as “barter’.

It may seem unbelievable, but long ago
people even used special stones as money!
Imagine how difficult it must have been
to carry this money!

People also used bricks of salt, shells and
cowries as money in the past.

They gave grain, farm produce, cattle, goats,
chickens, etc. in return for things like
clothes, tools and implements or as wages.

Then they began to use bits of precious metals
like gold, silver and copper as money.
It was easier to carry this money around.

Paper money was first used in China
about 1000 years ago.

Paper money or notes have no value
of their own, but a note is a ‘promise’
to give that much money.

These notes are printed by the government.
No one else is allowed to print notes.

You should not write on the notes or tear or es o
crumple the notes, or damage them in any way. @

You should also be careful when you spend money. BQ
People have to work hard to earn money!


1. Write a short note on ‘money’.

2. Look at the diagram on page 68. It is called a has
‘branches’. Now read the following and draw a tree diagram to show this
information.

Things in our surroundings form two groups — living
things and non-living things. Living things are of two kinds,
plants and animals. There are two types of plants — flowering

plants and non-flowering plants. If we consider animals,
we see that some animals lay eggs. They are oviparous
animals. Some animals give birth to their young ones. They
are viviparous animals.

Find more topics from your Environmental Studies or Mathematics textbooks for

Have you seen or used a computer?
Computers have brought about many
changes in the way we do things. One
of the most amazing features of the
computer world is the Internet or the
Net.

A network is a system of tubes,
wires, roads, etc. which are all connected
to each other. The internet or the net is a
network of computers. It links thousands
of computers or smaller networks of
computers with one another. It is so
large that millions of people around the
world can use it at the same time,

The internet makes it possible
for computer users to get or send
information very quickly. All you
have to do is to log on, that is, give
instructions to your computer to start
using the internet. Then you may see on
the net, all the information you need.
The information may be in the form of
text, pictures, moving images, or even
sounds, speeches or music. You can also
send your own information on the net.

Once you have gathered or given
the information on the internet, you can
log off, that is, give instructions to your
computer to get disconnected from the
net.

The internet is like an ocean of
information. You may wonder how one
can find tiny bits of information in this
ocean, but it is not at all difficult.

The information — on
the net is stored and made
available in a systematic
way on websites. Websites
are places on the net. Each
website has its own address.
Using this address, you
can visit a website, that is,
you can read or view the
information stored on it. The
thousands of websites on the
net together form the World
Wide Web (WWW).

There are special
computer programs known
as search engines which
help you to find the different
websites on the World Wide
Web. If you type the word
or subject on which you
want information, the search
engine shows on your screen,
alist of websites that have the
information. You can then go
to that website. Looking at the
various websites is known as
browsing or surfing the net.

A website is like a book
or magazine, but you cannot
make changes in a book once
it is printed. It is possible to
change the text or pictures
on a website as many times
as you like. So, makers of
the website can ‘update’ a
website.

sue Unit 4


While your computer is connected
to the internet, you are ‘online’. You
can do many things online like reading,
watching a movie, listening to songs
or even chatting and playing computer
games with other people who are
‘online’ in any part of the world at that
time. When you are not connected to the
net, you are ‘offline’.

Sometimes, you gather a lot of
information on the net which you want
to read or use later. What do you do,
then? You can make a ‘copy’ of the text
or pictures or movies on your Computer
and store it there. In other words, you
download the information on your
computer and then use it any time you
like.

To send information on the net,
you first need to get it ready on your
computer in the way you want it on the
net. You need a website to display the
information on the net.

You can also get your own personal
address on the net. You can receive
messages on this address and also
send them. This system of sending and
receiving messages ormail on computers
is known as ¢-mail or electronic mail.
Unit 4......

An e-mail address is
short and unique. No two
e-mail addresses are the
same. With the address,
you get an account on the
net. Your account is like
your own letter box on
the net. The only difference
is that you can use this
letter box not only for
receiving mail but also for
sending it. When you grow
up, you can get your own
e-mail account.

You can lock this
‘letter box’ by using a
password. A password is
a secret word or group of
letters and/or numbers.
The computer will allow
a person to use or see the
account only when the
person types the correct
password !

People who live in a

The proverb ‘A sound mind in a sound body’ simply means that
one’s body and mind should both be kept fit and healthy. We need a
healthy diet and proper exercise to keep our body fit. What do we do to
exercise our mind? The answer is quite simple. Just as we ‘work out’
or play games for physical exercise, we can use puzzles, riddles, board
games, jokes, etc. to exercise our mind. Let us look at some interesting
examples of games, puzzles, riddles and fun facts.

Nine Men’s Morris

This game is played with two
players. Each player has nine pieces,
one set black, one set white. You may
simply draw the board as shown
alongside and use buttons, beads,
seeds, etc. as pieces. The players
take turns to place their pieces (men)
in the empty spots, one at a time. If
you are able to place three ‘men’ in
a row or column, you form a ‘mill’.
Then you can remove one of your
opponent’s men. You cannot remove
men in your opponent's mill, unless
he/she has no other men left on the
board.

Once you have placed all your
men on the board, you can start
moving them only to an adjacent
empty spot.

If you have only three men left,

they can ‘fly’, that is, they can move
to any vacant spot on the board.

If a player has less than three
men left, or is unable to make a
move, he/she loses the game!

games like ‘tic-tac-toe’, “dots and

games. You can also invent your
own board games.

dveuecoveesusreveeprorsronserscseseseesee 32. Helen Keller

This is the story of a child who
became completely deaf and blind
before she had learnt to talk. Because
of her own courage
and also that of her
wonderful teacher
she learned to talk
and write. She was
able to go to school
and to college and to
live a full and happy
life.

Helen was born in
1880 in a small town
in the southern U.S.A.
At 18 months, when
she was beginning
to talk, she suddenly became terribly
ill and very nearly died. When she
recovered she was completely deaf
and blind.

It is very difficult for a deaf child
to learn to talk. Most babies learn by
hearing other people talking. But the
deaf child cannot hear anyone so how
can she know what talking sounds
like? Many deaf people learn to lip-
read, and they become very clever at
understanding what other people are
saying by watching them, But Helen
could not see what other people were
doing. She remembered a few words
she had known before she was ill, for
instance, she went on calling water
“waa-waa’. But she had to make signs
for most things. She would shake her
head for ‘No’, and nod for ‘Yes’. A

pull meant ‘Come’, and a push, ‘Go’.
But of course she could say very little
like this, and she depended entirely on
other people. Yet Helen
had an active mind and a
clever brain, and wanted
to do and say everything
any other child would.
She used to get into
terrible tempers when she
could not explain what
she meant, or understand
what others wanted.

Then when Helen
was nearly seven, Anne
Sullivan came to teach
her and look after her.
This clever and devoted teacher
changed Helen’s life.

Anne Sullivan herself had been
nearly blind and had been at a school
for blind people. There, Anne Sullivan
had learnt the fingerspelling method.
She felt sure that this was the only
way to talk to Helen and teach her to
say what she wanted. Because Helen
could not see her making the signs,
she would spell the words onto her
pupil’s hand, Helen had become very
sensitive to the feel of things, much
more sensitive than most people are.
She could soon tell the difference
between the feel of one letter and
another.

Miss Sullivan gave Helen a doll,
and when she gave it she spelled the

letters D-O-L-L onto Helen's hand.
She did this with the names of other
things, such as C-A-K-E, and M-U-G.
Helen obediently spelled them back;
but she did not understand what it all
meant, and she soon grew bored and
unhappy. She would not try any more,
and poor Anne Sullivan did not know
what to do next.

Then one day Miss Sullivan took
Helen outside to the water pump. As
the water spilled into Helen’s mug and
overflowed on her hand, Miss Sullivan
spelled W-A-T-E-R on her other hand.
Suddenly Helen’s face lit up, She
understood that W-A-T-E-R was the
name of this cold wet stuff, and it
came to her in a flash that everything
has a name.

Touching her little sister, she
spelled B-A-B-Y, which was one of
the words Miss Sullivan had shown
her. All that day and for days after,
Helen darted from one thing to the
next demanding that Miss Sullivan
should spell their names for her. She
became so excited she could hardly

control herself. At last words began
to have a meaning for her. She then
learned the names of actions as well
as things; SIT, STAND, RUN, WALK;
and then descriptions of things and
actions HARD, SOFT, QUICKLY,
SLOWLY. From then on she was able
to learn as any child does. Only, Helen
spelled words with her fingers instead
of saying them aloud. Although she
made noises, she still could not talk.

Now that she had started to learn,
Helen, with her quick brain and good
memory, learned very fast indeed.
She learned to spell words incredibly
fast, and soon she and her beloved
teacher could have long conversations.
Wherever they went, Miss Sullivan
described things to her and told her
what people were saying. Helen soon
learned to write on a special frame
with ridges to keep the lines straight,
and, later she learned to type. She
began to read Braille books.

The next thing was to learn to
talk aloud. For this she had a special
teacher who taught her how to move
her lips and tongue. Helen quickly
learned to talk also and to ‘listen’
to people speaking by putting her
sensitive fingers on their lips and
throats. This meant that she could
talk with people who did not know
the fingerspelling method, so long as
they spoke distinctly. All this was hard
work, needing endless patience by both
pupil and teacher, and long practice.

In time she could talk, read
and write, and even learnt to speak

French and German. Now Helen was
determined to go to university and
take a degree. When she was twenty,
she sat for the entrance examination
of Radcliffe College, one of the best
colleges in America. The papers were
set in Braille, and she typed her
answers. Of course, she could not
read what she had written. She had
to take a chance that she had made
no mistakes. She had no difficulty in
passing the examination and entering
Radcliffe.

1, Answer the following questions.

Miss Sullivan was with Helen all
through her time at the university. In
the end, this girl, who at seven had
lived in a dark world, unable to hear,
or speak, won high university honours.

Throughout her life, she helped
other blind people to find courage. She
travelled all over the world inspiring
everyone by her example.

Rangoli is one of the most beautiful and
most pleasing art forms of India. The word
Rangoli or Rangaawali consists of two words,
“rang” meaning ‘colour’ and ‘aawali’ meaning
a row or vine. Rangoli is the art of making
designs or patterns on the walls or the floor of
the house, using finely ground white powder
and different colours. In many households,
Rangoli designs are drawn in the courtyard or
in front of the doorstep every day.

The most interesting feature of Rangoli is
that it is drawn afresh every day. Just as you
cleanse and adorn yourself every day, you
clean your house and decorate it with a Rangoli
every day. On special occasions you wear
special clothes and ornaments. In the same
way, special magnificent designs are made on
the occasion of feasts and festivals.

Design and Patterns

The traditional form of Rangoli makes use
of designs and motifs based on nature, such
as mango, creepers, lotus and other flowers,
swans, peacocks, fish and other animals and so
on. Rangoli designs also include geometrical
patterns and shapes. Nowadays, other fancy
designs and free hand drawings are also used
to make beautiful Rangolis.

(x0). erereernertect eereernerters —— osemeeremsmesmienpunuennmesumusneentenins Unit 4

How it is Made

Usually, Rangoli lines are made
using coarse grained powders such as
sand, marble dust, saw dust, or rice grain
powder as it provides a good grip while
making the straight or curving lines. It
is important to draw unbroken lines of
even thickness to maintain the beauty of
the design. The skill to do so comes with
a lot of practice. The Rangoli can then
be left as a beautiful drawing or you can
fill it with bright coloured powders.

It is customary to prepare a special
background for Rangoli with Geru or
wet red ochre so that the white design
stands out very well. Also, usually, a
grid of rows and columns of dots is used
to give a proper frame and shape to the
design.

Rangoli and Diwali

Rangoli occupies a special place
in the festival of Deepawali or Diwali.
Since the art form is an expression of
warm hospitality, it is used by almost
everyone to decorate the courtyard
during the festival. It signifies that the
people coming to the house are welcome
inside.

Rangoli in Different States

Rangoli art is known by different
names in different parts of the country.
It is known as Chowkpurana in Uttar
Pradesh, Madana in Rajasthan, Muggu
in Andhra Pradesh, and as Rangoli in
Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra.
Each region has its special characteristic
designs and patterns. In the northern
parts of India, it is customary to make
Rangoli designs with traditional wet
colours.

In Bengal, Rangoli is known

as Alpanaa whereas in Bihar and
Uttaranchal itis named Aipanaa. Kolam
is the name given to the art of Rangoli
in southern parts of the country, mainly
in the States of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
Kolam designs are made with the help
of rice powder.


Rangoli in the Modern Days :

Rangoli art has been used for
centuries to beautify many Indian
households. Previously, it was used
mainly by women. Today both men
and women learn and practise this art,
adding their innovative ideas to the

traditional designs and motifs. At the
time of public celebrations, carpets of
Rangoli are spread over large areas and
even long distances. Some people use
leaves and flowers to make Rangolis
which are beautiful as well as fragrant.

~ For the Teacher -

The ‘Language Study’ pages contain a glossary or
explanation of certain terms that are used to talk about
language. These explanations should not be used as teaching
items or for evaluation. While handling the passages and
activities in the textbooks, the teachers may refer to these
pages from time to time, and get the students to read the
relevant parts ftom these pages, along with her. She should
also show how to look up a particular word in these pages.

Some of the terms have been introduced at the end of some
of the passages, with the help of questions like those given
below. Those terms have been introduced in a graded manner.
Once students become familiar with a term or explanation,
the teacher may occasionally set similar questions on other
suitable passages, for the purpose of revision.

Some question types :
Find nouns/ verbs from the paragraph given below.

Read the underlined nouns/ verbs and find 3-5 other
nouns / verbs related to each.

Complete the table; Type | : slow — slower — slowest
Type 2: go — went — gone


cast : a word that tells us
something more about a noun or
pronoun. Examples : a small box ;

fresh mangoes ; | am sorry ; the big,
brown, wooden board.

To show that something or
someone has ‘more’ of a quality, we
use ‘more’ before the adjective, eg.
more intelligent, more frightening. If
the adjective is short, (with only one
or two syllables in it), we add ‘-er’
instead of using ‘more’, eg., big-
bigger, happy-happier.

To show that something/someone
has more of a quality than anything/
anyone else, we use ‘most’ before
longer adjectives and add *-est’ to the
shorter adjectives. Examples : most
intelligent, most frightening, biggest,
happiest, softest.

There are many adjectives
which end with : -ful (useful), -less
(careless), -able (washable).

adverb : a word that tells us something
more about + a verb : He runs fast.
She went away. The girl sang sweetly.
Suddenly, the dogs started barking.
She did not smile. + an adjective :

very strong. * another adverb ; He
ran very fast. * a phrase or sentence
: Luckily, he remembered the answer.

Adverbs give us information
about : * place, eg. Come here.
Come in, * time, eg., | saw a movie
yesterday. Now | need a pen. * manner
or the way something is done, eg.,
Read aloud. Stand straight. « degree,

eg., The water was foo hot. * cause
or reason, eg., She was tired and
therefore unable to study.

We can use ‘more’ or ‘most’ with
some of the adverbs too, eg., Stitch
more carefully. She stitched it most
carefully,

We add -er or -est to short adverbs
like fast. Examples : Who ran faster ?
Who ran fastest of all ?

Many adverbs end with -/y.

om: The words ‘a / an’ and ‘the’ are
called articles. They are used before

to a particular example of something,
eg., |. am looking for the blue pen.

“A/an’ is called the indefinite
article. It shows that the noun refers
to a general example of something,
eg., | want a pen.

Before nouns beginning with a
consonant sound, we use ‘a’ ; and
before nouns beginning with a vowel
sound, we use ‘an’. We do this both
when we speak and when we write.
Examples : a lion, a squirrel, but an
ant, an elephant.

The definite article is always

written as ‘the’. But when we speak,
we pronounce it as @’ before consonant
sounds and ‘f@’ before vowel sounds,
eg., ‘2’ lion but ‘' elephant.

action is not complete; it goes on,
eg.. | am running. It is raining.

used to form questions and negatives.
“Do is not needed when these are

was not feeling well. She had not seen
the book.

There are other verbs like can,
could, may, might, will, would, shall,

These are known as modal verbs.
They, too, are used as auxiliaries

not work too hard. Must you go ?

Some verbs end with -ize (dramatize)
or -ify (classify).

mouth or throat. For example, ‘37°,
‘¥. A vowel /etter is a letter of the
alphabet that stands for a vowel
sound. The vowel letters are : a, e,

in different words. For example,
the same vowel letter ‘a’ stands for
different vowel sounds in the words
all, ate, ant, arm, etc.
