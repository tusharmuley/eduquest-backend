About us

Welcome To INSP Learning

The genesis of the Indian School of Physics (INSP) traces back to 2020 amidst the
upheaval of the Covid-19 pandemic when Nitin Sachan, a dedicated physics
teacher, initiated a YouTube channel. This platform aimed to aid students

grappling with academic disruptions during those challenging times.

INSP swiftly evolved into a nucleus for gifted students across India, renowned for its
top-notch content quality. Our core mission revolves around inspiring and
nurturing aspiring individuals to conquer milestones like JEE Mains, JEE Advanced,

and various Olympiads.

Within the INSP web portal, students are beckoned to explore the fundamental laws
that govern our world. What was once perceived as a daunting subject, physics

transforms into an enchanting voyage of guided discovery.

The pursuit of excellence in physics is neither overly complex nor straightforward; it
requires dedicated effort. While anyone can grasp the intricacies of physics, the

journey entails embracing challenges.

At INSP, swift solutions and constructive feedback for physics quandaries foster
rapid improvement. Studies affirm that problem-solving yields greater efficacy

than merely absorbing theoretical knowledge or passive lecture viewing.

The crux lies in mastering concepts and cultivating a comprehensive grasp of

physics and its real-world applications.

INSP primes individuals with vital skills essential for acing exams like JEE Advanced,
INPHO, and other Olympiads. Rigorous practice through problems of varying
difficulty levels fosters healthy competition, honing one's abilities against the finest

minds.

Confidence finds its foothold through the INSP learning methodology, empowering
